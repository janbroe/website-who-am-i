        <h1>Previous job</h1>
        <p>After my studies in electronics-ict, I immediately started working
          at Nokia. What does Nokia Antwerp do today? The Fixed Network
          department takes care of R&D and development of new products in the
          telecom sector. When developing this new hardware and equipment,
          everything must also be thoroughly tested. My job as a hardware
          dependent software engineer is to develop software so that the
          hardware designers can initially test their prototypes. Then they
          can verify that everything works as it should. When the prototypes
          move towards solid product, and are mass produced, my code is then
          used again to test the hardware before it leaves the factory. The
          advantage is that I am constantly working with different teams, so
          communication and teamwork are key.</p>
