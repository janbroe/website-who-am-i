          <h1>Previous job</h1>
          <p>After my studies in electronics-ict, I immediately started working
            at Nokia. What does Nokia Antwerp do today? The Fixed Network
            department takes care of R&D and development of new products in the
            telecom sector. When developing this new hardware and equipment,
            everything must also be thoroughly tested. My job as a hardware
            dependent software engineer is to develop software so that the
            hardware designers can initially test their prototypes. Then they
            can verify that everything works as it should. When the prototypes
            move towards solid product, and are mass produced, my code is then
             used again to test the hardware before it leaves the factory. The
             advantage is that I am constantly working with different teams, so
             communication and teamwork are key.</p>
