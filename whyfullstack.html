          <h1>Why fullstack?</h1>
          <p>After five and a half years of learning experience at Nokia, it is
            time for a new challenge. I would like to swap the low-level
            hardware business for a job as a full stack software engineer.
            The development and programming bug is still in me, but it is time
            for something new.</p>
          <p>It seems extremely interesting to me to master a total package of
            both front- and back-end in four months time and then to start
            directly at a company like Cegeka or Colruyt group. The endless
            possibilities in the full stack sector make it very interesting to
            be able to grow into this in the future. The fact that I can do all
            this in a dynamic environment completes the picture.</p>
          <p>The software that I develop at Nokia is written in C and runs in a
            Linux environment.  Occasionally I do some scripting in python.
            Since I am participating in the javascript track I have already
            started taking a course at freecodecamp to get up-to-speed with the
             syntax and additional constructions compared to C.</p>
