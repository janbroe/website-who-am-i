        <h1>Why fullstack?</h1>
        <p>After five and a half years of learning experience at Nokia, it is
        time for a new challenge. I would like to swap the low-level
        hardware business for a job as a full stack software engineer.
        The development and programming bug is still in me, but it is time
        for something new.</p>
        <p>It seems extremely interesting to me to master a total package of
        both front- and back-end in four months time and then to start
        directly at a company like Cegeka or Colruyt group. The endless
        possibilities in the full stack sector make it very interesting to
        be able to grow into this in the future. The fact that I can do all
        this in a dynamic environment completes the picture.</p>
        <p>The software that I develop at Nokia is written in C and runs in a
        Linux environment.  Occasionally I do some scripting in python.
        Since I am participating in the javascript track I have already
        started taking a course at freecodecamp to get up-to-speed with the
        syntax and additional constructions compared to C.</p>
