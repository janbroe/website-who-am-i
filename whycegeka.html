          <h1>Why Cegeka?</h1>
          <p>The company Cegeka first came to my attention through a friend.
            That's how I found out that it was first a small Limburg family
            business that has grown into a very big player in IT. After more
            research I could conclude that for me this is by far the most
            interesting company in the list of Switchfully. Just the fact that
            consultancy is offered really appeals to me. This way you can gain
            experience on different projects to learn as much as possible.
            Cegeka also offers various services and platforms in different
            industries to their customers. This ensures that you do not remain
            restricted in your growth and are offered sufficient challenge and
            variety. I think the emphasis on the close contact with customers
            and the personalized experience that comes with it is fantastic.
